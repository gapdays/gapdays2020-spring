This note will also be updated as the workshop nears with more information and details about the various work packages.


## Schedule
Each day will be kicked off with short stand-up talks to update everyone on progress, issues and next steps.
To avoid major conflicts and uncontrolled merges we ask for hourly commits/pushes and exchanges (also we are human, we can talk to each other).
The official end of these GAP Days will be around 3pm on Friday (but for the hardcore GAPers you are welcome to stick around for longer). 
This schedule is very flexible as it is highly dependent on the work progress, and any issues that might come up. 
Thus in the "work" slots, there is freedom for impromptu discussions, talks or other formats of communication.

The overall idea for the progress throughout the week will for everyone to start off with an overhaul of the webpage infrastructure, before splitting into separate groups working on the webpage and release management. 
This is done so that the cross-over of some of the release mechanisms that involve the webpage (version number, package management etc.) are dealt with hand in hand.
