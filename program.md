### Organisational notepad for the GAP Days

[Link to the HackMD for GAP Days Spring
2019](https://hackmd.io/9ctY1jNaTiOm2-eUUQOjlw).  In this notepad, we invite you
to share organisational information, and details about what you want to work
on/have worked on during the GAP Days.


## Detailed schedule

We will open with a meeting at 10am on Monday to coordinate plans for the week,
and follow a pattern of "Standups" each day at around 9am and 4:30pm, to
communicate what we plan to work on, and what we have worked on, respectively.
We will close the meeting at around 3pm on Friday.

## Topics and projects

The overarching theme of this GAP Days will be GAP's infrastructure for
computing with permutation groups, such as orbit and stabiliser algorithms, base
and strong generating sets, partition backtrack for stabiliser, normaliser, and
canonical images, chief series, Sylow subgroups, Schur multipliers and
cohomology, and recognition methods for permutation groups.  If you have any
queries or suggestions, then please do not hesitate to contact the organisers.

1. __Overview of existing permutation group code in GAP__

2. __Partition backtrack methods in the GAP library__

3. __Recognition methods for large base groups__
